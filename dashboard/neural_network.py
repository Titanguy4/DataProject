    Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) 
    that process input data to make predictions. Deep learning, a subset of neural networks, involves large networks with 
    many hidden layers to solve complex problems like image recognition, natural language processing, and more.
